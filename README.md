# MoPReport

This is a World of Warcraft addon.

Check your Pandaria daily quests, work orders, currencies, world bosses and reputations in one place.  

Game Addon Categories: Quests & Leveling.  

Our goal is simple, make as easy as possible for everyone to get access to relevant information during gameplay. With this simple window addon we bring to Mists of Pandaria the same feeling of using the reports and sumary windows existing in retail since Warlords of Draenor (6.0.0). Check what you have already done today or this week, locate NPCs, track reputations, hunt world bosses and more.
